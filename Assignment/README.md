## Submit assignment notebook here

This week there is one notebook that should be submitted by pull request.

You should complete the problems in Notebook 5.4 and then create a *copy* of that notebook and rename it and place it here in the Assignments directory. Then commit it to your forked repository and make a pull request to the upstream branch GitHub. 


#### After finishing edits to Notebook nb-5.4-numpy-hands-on
```bash
# copy notebook to Assignments and rename it
cp Notebook/nb-5.4-numpy-hands-on Assignment/<myname>-5.4.ipynb
```
