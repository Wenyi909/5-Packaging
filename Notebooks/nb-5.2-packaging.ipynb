    "# Writing a Python package\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to create an installable Python package. The notation for which is a bit idiosyncratic, but once understood is also quite simple. Once finished, our package can be imported without having to be located in the directory in which we are working. This is a first step in moving towards using a more professional style of code development. \n",

However, I think it will make more sense if you first give it a try. So I recommend completing this notebook and returning to the reading above if you have further questions. You don't need to read too deep into this, it's extra reading for those interested, because it's pretty advanced stuff. "

By running a pip install with the argument `-e` the package will be installed in a way that it automatically tracks all of the changes you make to this directory. This means that when you make changes to the code in your source directory (e.g., `~/PDSB/helloworld`) those changes will be incorporated next time you run your code without you having to run `install` again to make it aware of the updates. To run this command you need have `cd`'d into the directory and run it with the `.` location, to tell it here. "
