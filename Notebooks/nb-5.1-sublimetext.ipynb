    "Learning to use an efficient coding text-editor can help to superpower your coding skills. It makes it dramatically easier to search through long scripts, jump between different script files, and to test changes in your code. Many good text editors will *even point out errors in your code before you run it*, which can save you a lot of time, or highlight which lines have been changed since your last git commit. "

    "Emacs and Vim have been around the longest and have historically been pitted against each other as a sort of zero-sum battle to the death. Everyone learns one or the other, completely falls in love with their choice, and then despises the competing editor. This is partly because they are so different in style, and when you get comfortable with one it feels unnatural to change. So far, most of you will have at least tried out the simple text editor `nano`, which uses a set of key-bindings similar to those in `emacs`, which is the editor that I originally learned on. I eventually moved on to `SublimeText`, but within it I use keybindings (keyboard shortcuts) similar to emacs. Since we only have limited time to spend on text editors I'll teach you the editor that I use, to give you a good idea of its capabilities, but you may be interested in trying others later to find your favorite. `Sublimetext` and `Atom` are the modern choice for most users, but many people still use either of them with third-party add-ons that allow the use of older emacs or vim-style keybindings.

Create one now by editing this file *with Sublime* and adding the following line `alias subl=\"/c/Program\\ Files/Sublime\\ Text\\ 3/sublime_text.exe\"`. As usual, take care that you cannot have any typos in the path to the sublime exe file or the alias will not work. Save the file when you are done and close the sublime window. Then run `source ~/.bash_profile`. Now you should be able to run `subl .` to open the current directory in sublime. "

    "There is a huge range of settings that you use to customize your experience in sublimetext. And perhaps the best part about sublime is that the code itself is *all written in Python*. This means it's actually not that hard to write your own customizations, or at least to understand the code others have written when you search for a type of customization. Custom settings are entered by typing `Settings` into the command palette. This will open a new window with two files side-by-side. The left one is `Preferences.sublime-settings -- Default` and the right one is `Preferences.sublime-settings -- User`. The one of the left shows you all of the default settings that you can change. To change one simply copy it to the User window on the right and change it's value. Let's make a simple change by adding a `ruler` to our text window. Add the following line to the User file inside of the curly braces: `ruler: [80],`. This will make a vertical line at 80 characters. This is a good indicator that you shouldn't write code that is longer than 80 characters wide without making a line brak, since that would be poor style. "

The key-bindings for emacs are very user friendly, and are the same as for the `nano` editor that we've used already. Whereas the emacs keybindings make it easy to move your cursor up-down-left-right by individual characters, the sublime key-bindings instead are aimed towards always searching for words that you can see on the screen. Either is fine, but takes practice to get used to. If you like the emacs way, you can install it here. Otherwise, take time to try to learn the sublime way. "
